# Project create with Create React App

So all comands for running app are standart

For correct work app don't forget start the server

If you start the server locally don't forget change REACT_APP_BASE_URL at the ".env" file
Basically you need it for correct work of your requests to the server

App give you a chance find your train for your trip

Basicly, there are not a lot of trains and roads, so you can often see on your screen a message like
"Sorry, there are no trains to this route!"
So, try to use next stations "Kyiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Odesa"

Good luck!
